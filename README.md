# 🧠 NLP Tasks Repository

This repository contains implementations of various **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** tasks. The goal of this work is to explore how raw text can be transformed, analyzed, and modeled to extract meaningful insights using both traditional ML and deep learning techniques.

---

## 📌 Implemented Tasks

### 🔹 Text Preprocessing

* Tokenization
* Stopword removal
* Lemmatization & stemming
* Lowercasing & cleaning text

### 🔹 Text Classification

* Sentiment Analysis (Positive/Negative)
* Multiclass classification (e.g., product reviews, IMDb dataset)
* Models: Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks (Keras)

### 🔹 Topic Modeling

* Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
* Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

### 🔹 Word Embeddings

* Word2Vec
* GloVe
* Manual loading of pre-trained embeddings

### 🔹 Feature Engineering

* Bag of Words (BoW)
* TF-IDF
* Dimensionality reduction for text
